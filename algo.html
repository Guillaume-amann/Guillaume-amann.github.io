        <h1>Financial Library for Position Management and Analysis</h1>
        <p>This project provides a financial library designed for managing and analyzing financial positions, 
            specifically focused on stocks, bonds, and options. The library includes a <code>Position</code> 
            class to manage and track position attributes, calculate returns, and monitor portfolio performance. 
            All the web scraping is done via Python. For reasons of mathematical rigor, the programming language 
            OCaml is used for data and model testing, while C++ is privileged for all the remaining computations 
            (calculus, regression, etc.).</p>
    
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Position Management:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Track essential attributes like ticker, price bought, volume, and returns for each position.</li>
                    <li>Automatically logs daily position data in <code>Portfolio/Positions.csv</code>.</li>
                    <li>Initializes each <code>Position</code> object with a ticker symbol and corresponding line in <code>Positions.csv</code> for easy data parsing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>checkPosition</code> method calculates the position's length and return, offering a straightforward overview of performance.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Storage:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Daily positions are saved in CSV format, ensuring a clear record of historical data.</li>
                    <li>Filename for positions is set to <code>Portfolio/Positions.csv</code> by default.</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Project Structure</h2>
        <p>Feel free to explore the <strong>Overview.pptx</strong> that maps the architecture of the project.</p>
    
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)</li>
            <li>Standard C++ libraries</li>
            <li>Python 3.13</li>
            <li><code>yfinance</code> Python library</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>macOS Version</h2>
        <p>If on macOS and want to automate the email alerts, please use the scripts in the <code>macOS_scripts</code> folder. Place the <code>auto.sh</code> file somewhere in <code>Users/username/</code> but neither in Documents nor in Downloads as Apple tends to restrict access to these folders. This might lead to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Unload failed: 5: Input/output error 'Try running launchctl bootout' as root for richer errors.</code></li>
            <li><code>/bin/bash ... operation not permitted</code> in the error log file if the script eventually loads.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Hybrid Financial Instrument Recommendation System for Traders
                <h1>Objective</h1>
                <p>
                    To develop a hybrid recommendation system that proposes financial instruments 
                    (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) based on other traders' performance and risk requirements using both collaborative filtering and content-based techniques.
                </p>
                
                <h1>1. Data Collection</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gather historical trading data for various financial instruments with relevant information such as price, volume, return, and risk factors (e.g., volatility, beta).</li>
                    <li>Collect user profiles containing information about each trader's risk preferences, investment objectives, portfolio allocation, and trading history.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1>2. Data Preprocessing</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.</li>
                    <li>Normalize the financial instrument data for proper comparison.</li>
                    <li>Transform user profiles into numerical vectors that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1>3. Collaborative Filtering</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify similar traders based on their trading behavior, risk preferences, and investment objectives using techniques like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation coefficient.</li>
                    <li>Recommend financial instruments that have performed well for the most similar traders (k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm can be used).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1>4. Content-Based Filtering</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyze the features of each financial instrument to identify patterns and characteristics that might be of interest to a trader (e.g., sector, industry, geographical location, market capitalization, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Recommend financial instruments based on their alignment with a user's stated investment preferences and risk requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1>5. Hybrid Approach</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combine the recommendations from both collaborative filtering and content-based techniques to create a more comprehensive and accurate list of potential financial instruments for each trader.</li>
                    <li>Weight the importance of each method based on factors such as the diversity of the user's portfolio, their risk tolerance, and the recency of their trading activity.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1>6. Evaluation</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Measure the effectiveness of the recommendation system by comparing the performance of recommended financial instruments with a control group that did not receive any recommendations (A/B testing).</li>
                    <li>Utilize metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and mean absolute error to evaluate the performance of the hybrid approach.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1>7. Iterative Improvement</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Continuously monitor the system's performance and make adjustments as necessary to improve the recommendations (e.g., adding new features or tweaking the weighting between collaborative filtering and content-based methods).</li>
                    <li>Regularly update the data used for training to ensure that the recommendation system remains accurate and relevant.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
